Topic Analysis Assignment

 

Topic 1: Implementation of Zero-Trust Architecture Principles

Initial Interest Level:  9/10 — This corresponds with my focus on the blue team and my interest in automation.  My motivation lies in creating identity-aware, segmented networks that limit blast radius, inhibit lateral movement, and eliminate implicit trust.

Feasibility Assessment

Resources/Tools needed:

• Lab setup: Virtual Box/VMware for local simulation or a minimal AWS/Azure account
• Access proxy & segmentation: Pomerium/Teleport for identity-aware access; optional Kubernetes + Calico for microsegmentation.
• Observability & detections: Zeek, Suricata, ELK/OpenSearch; basic SIEM pipeline and alerting.
• Documentation: diagrams.net for architecture, Word/Markdown for runbooks and reports.
Current knowledge level: Intermediate: virtualization, fundamental VPNs, concepts of segmentation, and essential blue-team practices from coursework and home labs

What I would need to learn:

• NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture pillars and reference models.
• IdP integrations, policy-as-code patterns.
• Measuring control effectiveness, writing detections tied to the design.
Project vs Research Classification

Type: Project-based

Main deliverable: Provide a formal architecture document, threat assessment, and a functional lab prototype demonstrating identity-aware access, least privilege, and microsegmentation; include a test plan, findings, and an operations runbook

Real-World Application

How this addresses current challenges: Addresses credential abuse, lateral movement, and over-privileged access—top drivers of breach impact in hybrid/cloud environments.

Industry need fulfilled: Meets an industry need for practical Zero Trust roadmaps that support remote work, reduce breach blast radius, and align with compliance expectations.

Potential Career Connection

Alignment with my goals: Directly supports goals in network defense and cloud security engineering, building credible portfolio.

Skills I would develop:

• Network architecture & microsegmentation
• IAM/SSO integration and access proxying
• Policy-as-code and control validation
• Logging/monitoring and basic detection engineering
• Runbook authoring and executive-style reporting
 
 

 

 

Topic 2: AI-Powered Phishing Detection System
Initial Interest Level: 8/10 — Combines programming with real-world defense. Phishing continues to be a key initial-access method; I aim to create a reliable, understandable detector

Feasibility Assessment

Resources/Tools needed:

• Datasets: labeled phishing vs. benign emails/URLs and safe feature extraction tooling.
• Tooling: Python, scikit-learn or light models; optional embeddings/transformers; spaCy for NLP preprocessing.
• Integration: email gateway simulation, URL sandboxing hooks, logging/alerting to emulate SOC workflows.
• Evaluation: precision/recall, ROC/AUC, confusion matrices; adversarial robustness checks and ablation studies.
Current knowledge level: Comfortable with Python and data handling; introductory ML knowledge from self-study and labs.

What I would need to learn:

• Feature engineering (headers, lexical/URL features, HTML structure, sender reputation signals).
• Robust evaluation to avoid leakage/overfitting; data governance and privacy considerations.
• Operationalization: tuning thresholds, analyst feedback loops, and explainability for trust.
Project vs Research Classification

Type: Project-based

Main deliverable: Deliver a working prototype with a technical report: data pipeline, model, metrics, ablations, and an operational deployment plan with guardrails.

Real-World Application

How this addresses current challenges: Targets persistent phishing that drives credential theft and ransomware initial access; reduces analyst toil via triage auto-classification.

Industry need fulfilled: Serves industry need for cost-effective, explainable filters that integrate cleanly into existing security tooling.

Potential Career Connection

Alignment with my goals: Builds experience relevant to security engineering and detection/automation roles.

Skills I would develop:

• Python/NLP data pipelines
• Model evaluation and MLOps hygiene
• Security product thinking and UX for analysts
• Detection tuning and continuous improvement
