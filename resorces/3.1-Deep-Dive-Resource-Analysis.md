## Topic Analysis Assignment
## Topic 1: Implementation of Zero-Trust Architecture Principles
## Resource 1

- Citation: Mani, S. K., Hussain, M., Hasan, S., Zhou, K., Zou, X., & Sekar, V. (2025). Securing public cloud networks with efficient role-based micro-segmentation. USENIX NSDI ’25.

- Type: Peer-reviewed conference paper

- Synopsis: Practical micro-segmentation at cloud scale using roles inferred from flow logs. Good ideas for turning network behavior into policies and measuring impact. It’s a research prototype, but the evaluation gives me concrete ways to test segmentation in my lab.

- Link:https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi25-mani.pdf

- Relevance: 5/5 – Directly maps to my limit blast radius goal and how I would validate it.
  
## Resource 2 

- Citation: Nahar, N., Andersson, K., & Saguna, S. (2024). A survey on Zero-Trust Architecture: Applications and challenges of 6G networks. IEEE Access, 12, 1–20.

- Type: Peer-reviewed journal article 

- Synopsis: Clean overview of ZTA concepts, auth models, and open issues. It’s framed around 6G, but the core ZTA pieces help me organize my architecture doc and “related work” section.

- Link:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382120313_A_Survey_on_Zero_Trust_Architecture_Applications_and_Challenges_of_6G_Networks

- Relevance: 4.5/5 – Solid literature grounding I can cite next to NIST/CISA.
  
## Resource 3

- Citation: Rose, S., Borchert, O., Mitchell, S., & Connelly, S. (2020). Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207). National Institute of Standards and Technology. 

- Type: Government research report / standard

- Synopsis: The baseline. Defines ZT, components, and deployment patterns. I’ll use this to shape the architecture, runbook sections, and vocabulary in my write-up.

- Link: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf

- Relevance: 5/5 – This is the map I’ll align my lab to.

## Resource 4 

- Citation: CISA. (2023). Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0. U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

- Type: Government maturity model / implementation guide 

- Synopsis: A practical checklist for where you are vs. where you want to be across Identity, Devices, Network/Env, Apps, Data, and Visibility/Analytics. I can turn this into my test plan and control effectiveness scoring.

- Link:https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf

- Relevance: 5/5 – Exactly what I need to measure progress and report to execs.

## Topic 2: AI-Powered Phishing Detection System
##Resource 1 

- Citation: Liu, R., Lin, Y., Yang, X., Ng, S. H., Divakaran, D. M., & Dong, J. S. (2022). Inferring phishing intention via webpage appearance and dynamics: A deep vision-based approach. USENIX Security ’22.

- Type: Peer-reviewed conference paper

- Synopsis: PhishIntention uses computer vision + interaction to detect brand/credential-stealing intent—even with HTML obfuscation. Great reference for explainability and for comparing my email/URL features to page-content signals.

- Link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/liu-ruofan

- Relevance: 4.5/5 – Strong baseline for intent-level detection and model design ideas.

## Resource 2 

- Citation: Haq, Q. E., Sadiq, S., Shafique, A., & Farooq, M. (2024). Detecting phishing URLs based on a deep learning approach using 1D-CNN. Applied Sciences, 14(22), 10086.

- Type: Peer-reviewed journal article

- Synopsis: Clean 1D-CNN over URL strings—simple pipeline, good accuracy. Helpful for a lightweight baseline before I try heavier NLP/transformers. I’ll watch for dataset splits to avoid leakage.

- Link: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/22/10086

- Relevance: 4/5 – Solid starting point and benchmark for my ablations.

## Resource 3

- Citation: Anti-Phishing Working Group. (2025). Phishing Activity Trends Report: Q2 2025.

- Type: Industry report / statistics

- Synopsis: Fresh stats over 1.13M attacks in Q2. Useful for scoping the problem, picking current threat flavors, and justifying my evaluation scenarios.

- Link: https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2025.pdf

- Relevance: 5/5 – Current threat context to guide test cases and thresholds.

## Resource 4 

- Citation: Microsoft Threat Intelligence. (2024, November 4). How Microsoft Defender for Office 365 innovated to address QR-code phishing attacks. Microsoft Security Blog.

- Type: Vendor blog / case study

- Synopsis: Real defender tactics for QR-based phishing. Good inspiration for my ops plan, alerts, and analyst handoff loop.
