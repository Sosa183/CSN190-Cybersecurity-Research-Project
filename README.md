## Using machine learning to detect malicious URLs ##

**Author:** Albert Sosa

**Institution:** Bronx Community College

## Project Overview,
This project builds a Python-based machine learning system that classifies URLs as malicious or benign. It uses feature extraction, data preprocessing, and a trained ML model to predict whether a URL poses a threat. The project demonstrates cybersecurity automation, threat detection, and hands-on experience with Python, scikit-learn, and phishing datasets.

## Software/Tools Used,
Python 3.x

PyCharm (IDE)

scikit-learn

pandas / numpy

matplotlib

Flask (optional API server)

GitHub for documentation

## Key Deliverables,

## Repository Navigation,
/weekly-progress/ - All weekly assignments and progress updates,
/resources/ - Compiled research sources and bibliography,
/src/ - Source code and project files,
/docs/ - Technical documentation and guides,
/final-paper/ - Research papers and articles,
/images/ - Screenshots and visual documentation,

## Getting Started,
To replicate this project, begin by cloning the repository from GitHub and opening it in PyCharm. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system, then install all required dependencies using python -m pip install --upgrade pip followed by python -m pip install -r REQUIREMENTS. Once your environment is ready, confirm that the dataset (data.csv) is located inside the data/ folder, as it is required for training and testing the model. After everything is set up, run my_url_classifier.py to train the machine learning model and generate predictions. If you want to use the optional web API, you can run AIserver.py, which starts a simple server that lets you test URL classifications through an API endpoint. All necessary files, screenshots, and documentation are included in the repository so you can fully reproduce the workflow and make your own modifications.

## Results Summary,
Through this project, I successfully built a working machine learning model that detects malicious URLs using Python and scikit-learn. I was able to clean and preprocess a real-world dataset, extract meaningful URL features, train multiple models, and compare their accuracy to determine which classifier performed best. I also organized the project into a clean GitHub repository and created a working environment in PyCharm, even after troubleshooting issues like “pip not recognized,” missing libraries, and Python not being found on the system.

I learned how machine learning can be applied to cybersecurity by automating phishing detection and improving threat analysis. I also gained practical experience with debugging, dependency management, dataset handling, and documenting a project professionally. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in cybersecurity, Python development, and machine learning workflows while giving me a real, hands-on understanding of how malicious URLs can be identified through automation.
