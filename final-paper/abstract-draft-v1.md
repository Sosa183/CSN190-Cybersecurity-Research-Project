Phishing continues to be the easiest way in, and a basic home or student network can enable one unfortunate click to spread rapidly. Numerous students do not have a budget-friendly, effective plan that shows how to reduce that spread and recognize harmful connections with available tools. I will develop and evaluate a concise zero-trust setup and a straightforward URL structure. My question is simple: how much can I limit lateral movement, and how well can I identify phishing while reducing false positives? I will set up a consumer router using pfSense or OpenWrt to create three VLANs for IoT, personal devices, and lab activities, enforcing allow lists specifically for the needs of each segment. I will assess a nine-pair reachability matrix with Nmap and Scapy for ports 22, 80, and 443, while recording allow versus deny. In Python, I will gather lexical characteristics like length, digit ratio, hyphen count, subdomain depth, and brand-spoof tokens, alongside WHOIS domain age, and then train logistic regression and random forest models with pandas and scikit-learn on about 8,000 URLs that are equally split between benign and malicious. I will use five-fold cross-validation and present metrics for precision, recall, F1, and ROC AUC, while also estimating a real-world false positive rate based on 200 clean URLs. I expect at least a ninety percent reduction in unauthorized lateral reach and an F1 score of no less than 0.90, with false positives not exceeding two percent. The outcome will be an all-inclusive manual containing setups, testing scripts, and code that anyone can easily duplicate at low cost.

I covered all five parts: background and context, the problem, my purpose and main question, methods for the network and the model, and the expected results. It is specific because I name the router stack, three VLANs, a nine-pair test on ports 22, 80, and 443, about eight thousand labeled URLs, five-fold cross-validation, and the exact metrics I will report. The hard part was scoping it to fit my hardware and time while still giving numbers that matter. I kept the targets firm but reachable and pushed extras like DNS sinkholing and an IDS tap to later. This matches my Assignment 4.1 plan by sticking to the realistic tier and delivering a repeatable lab with measurable outcomes.
