Part C: Final Topic Selection
Zero-Trust lab: I’ll build a small environment with two lightweight web apps, place Pomerium in front for single sign-on using an OIDC provider on Google, write a few least-privilege policies, and test what gets allowed versus what gets blocked. I’ll document setup, show blocked attempts, and record a quick latency snapshot so I’m not just claiming “Zero-Trust” but actually demonstrating it.
Why This Topic
It’s achievable because it runs locally with Docker and mature docs, no cloud bill, no heavy Kubernetes required. This is meaningful to me because I want blue team platform security skills that align with real-world job requirements. The scope balances feasibility and growth: a clear baseline I can finish in 8–10 weeks, with optional stretch work if time allows.
Three-Tier Plan
Ambitious Goal: Expand to micro-segmentation using OpenZiti, enforce mTLS end-to-end, add simple device time context checks, stand up a tiny CI step to lint test policy files, ship a Grafana panel for auth outcomes latency, and map my controls to NIST SP 800-207/CISA with a short gap analysis and a 3–5 minute demo video.
Realistic Target: Docker Compose lab with two services behind Pomerium SSO, at least two clear policies that dictate who can access, when/from where screenshots of blocked vs. allowed flows, and a short write-up with a quick latency snapshot and lessons learned.
Minimum Viable Outcome: One app protected by Pomerium SSO, one allow policy, and one deny policy that I can prove with a scripted test, plus a one-page runbook so a classmate could repeat it.
The Learning Value
I’ll develop practical skills in OIDC basics, reverse-proxy configuration, TLS, policy-as-code thinking, and evidence-driven testing. Even if I don’t finish the ambitious stretch, attempting this is valuable because I’ll still produce a reproducible lab, show real control behavior, and explain trade-offs clearly. That demonstrates I can design, implement, and communicate security controls, not just follow a tutorial, and it gives me a small, portfolio-ready project aligned to my career goals.
