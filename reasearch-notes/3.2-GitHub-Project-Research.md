## GitHub Project Research
## Zero-Trust Architecture
## GitHub Project 1 (Pomerium)

- Citation: Pomerium. (2025). Pomerium – identity & context-aware access proxy. GitHub. https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium

- Type: Security Tool (access proxy)

- Synopsis: I use Pomerium when I want BeyondCorp-style access without spinning up a full VPN. It sits in front of internal web apps and enforces policy based on who you are and the context. Plays nicely with Kubernetes and has clean docs. Limitation: it’s app/TCP access, not a whole network overlay.

- Link and Docs: https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium, https://www.pomerium.com/docs/

- Relevance: 5/5, Perfect for my ZTA lab: identity-aware policies, quick demos, and apples-to-apples comparisons against a traditional VPN.

## GitHub Project 2  (OpenZiti)

- Citation: OpenZiti. (2025). OpenZiti – programmable zero-trust overlay. GitHub. https://github.com/openziti/ziti

- Type: Framework/platform
  
- Synopsis: When I need ZTA beyond web apps, OpenZiti gives me a full overlay plus SDKs so I can bake access directly into the app. There are controllers, routers, desktop clients, and Helm charts to get moving in K8s. Limitation: bigger learning curve than a single proxy.

- Link and Docs: https://github.com/openziti/ziti, https://openziti.io/

- Relevance: 5/5, Great complement to Pomerium for end-to-end overlay experiments and ZT-inside-the-app patterns.

## AI-Powered Phishing Detection
## GitHub Project 1 (Sublime Platform)

- Citation: Sublime Security. (2025). Sublime Platform – open email-security & detections-as-code. GitHub. https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-platform

- Type: Security Tool / educational framework

- Synopsis: This is my go-to for transparent email detections. It uses a simple rule language and open rules for BEC/phishing/malware, which makes testing ideas easy and explainable. It’s a platform, not a single ML model, so integration work is expected.

- Link and Docs: https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-platform, https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-rules
-  
- Relevance: 5/5, Perfect sandbox to pair with my ML experiments and measure rule-vs-model tradeoffs.
  
## GitHub Project 2 (Malicious URL ML Baseline)

- Citation: Ahmad, F. (2017–2025). Using machine learning to detect malicious URLs. GitHub. https://github.com/faizann24/Using-machine-learning-to-detect-malicious-URLs

- Type: Educational repo/research implementation

- Synopsis: A solid baseline for URL-only phishing detection: classic features and traditional classifiers. It’s older, but that’s the point, great for reproducing a baseline before I jump to transformers or multimodal setups. Not a full email pipeline.

- Link and Docs: GitHub - faizann24/Using-machine-learning-to-detect-malicious-URLs

- Relevance: 5/5, Useful yardstick to prove my newer models actually beat something concrete.
